 [ TOOL DESCRIPTION ]
 Scanning WAN networks in search of targets may take 10 to 15 minutes depending
 of your network connection, the tool will search in 1024 random hosts for the
 selected port open, then port hosts found to metasploit database, and run the
 conrrespondent 'exploit.rc' againts all hosts stored into 'RHOSTS' variable.
 All rc files will use nmap nse scripting enginne to gather information and
 msf auxiliarys modules to gather information + brute-force service selected.
 'Each discovered matching login and password will create one shell session'

 By default rc-exploiter uses 'one-per-line' dicionarys to brute-force services
 found or we can provide the full path to another dicionary file to be used, also
 rc-exploiter give us the abillity to exploit multiple targets at once (RHOSTS)
 for that just separate the hosts by a blank space [ eg: 127.0.0.1 192.168.1.68 ]






 [ CONFIG INTERNAL SETTINGS ]
 To costumise internal tool settings, just edit the file 'settings' stored under
 '/RC-exploiter/' directory, and change the next values to suit your needs:

 1º - clear 'log' folder on exit? (clear all .log files)
 2º - write_logfiles (nmap + msf) into /shell/logs folder
 3º - use decoys to scan targets (cover tracks in IDS)
 4º - spoof your mac addr and ip addr (cover tracks in IDS)
 5º - nmap NSE scripts/nselib folder install path (needed to http and ssl attacks)




 [ ACTIVATE LOGIN PROTECTED ]
 This funtion will ask you to input a password (your choise) and uses 'base64' to encode/
 decode the string, then the next time the script will be executed, it asks for input a
 'script access password'...




 [ DICIONARY FILES ]
 This script brings two dicionary files named: 'Default.txt' and 'user:pass.txt' and
 they are stored in '/RC-exploiter/dicionarys/' directory, Any of then can be edited
 to insert new entrys, or we can provide the full path to use another dictionary file
 to be used in brute-force hosts stored into 'RHOSTS global variable' (set by attacker)

 the 'Default.txt' dicionary as usernames 'one per line' (example => root) 
 the 'user:pass.txt' dicionary as username and password (example => root:pass)






 [ WHAT ARE 'EXPLOITS.RC' ]
 They are little pieces of code that uses metasploit scripting language 'ERB' to 
 incorporate 'RUBY' or 'msfconsole core commands' into one text file, the ERB was
 develop by 'HD MOORE' has one way to automate the framework (metasploit) and my
 'exploits.rc' resource files works in two steps:

 1º - uses <ruby> tag to store scans made by 'db_nmap nse' into the msf database
 2º - runs various msf auxiliary's againts all 'RHOSTS' stored in the global variable

 [ USING DECOYS ]
 To use this funtion just edit the file 'settings' to start using 'decoys' in performing
 scans (use decoys to fool target IDS) just use the follow settings to use decoys:

 USE_DECOYS=YES

 Also you can provide your own fake ip addr (decoy) or use the default one
 just change the next value in 'settings' file to use another decoy IP address.

 DECOY_IP_ADDR=162.144.100.186






 [ SPOOF MAC ADDRESS ]
 To use this funtion we need to edit the file 'settings' to Cloak our mac address using
 'macchanger' software, if active this setting will change random your mac-address
 and your ip-address, just use the follow settings to generate a random MAC + IP addr
 everytime the script runs (the settings will be active until we exit the tool):

 SPOOF_MAC=YES
 RANDOM=YES

 Or we can use allways the same fake mac addr, just set 'RANDOM=NO' to use the default
 spoofed_mac, or we can provide our own spoofed_mac (optional), just by changing the
 the value 'SPOOFED_MAC=22:da:88:a8:04:b8' to our needs:

 SPOOF_MAC=YES
 RANDOM=NO
 SPOOFED_MAC=22:da:88:a8:04:b8
