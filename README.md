# LEGAL DISCLAMER
    The author does not hold any responsibility about the bad use of this script,
    remmenber that attacking targets without prior concent its ilegal and punish
    by law, this script was build to show how resource files can automate tasks.

# Framework description
    Scanning WAN networks in search of targets may take 10 to 15 minutes depending
    of your network connection, the tool will search in 1024 random hosts for the
    selected port open, then port hosts found to metasploit database, and run the
    conrrespondent 'exploit.rc' againts all hosts stored into 'RHOSTS' variable.
    All rc files will use nmap nse scripting enginne to gather information and
    msf auxiliarys modules to gather information + brute-force service selected.
    'Each discovered matching login and password will create one shell session'

    By default rc-exploiter uses 'one-per-line' dicionarys to brute-force services
    found or we can provide the full path to another dicionary file to be used, also
    rc-exploiter give us the abillity to exploit multiple targets at once (RHOSTS)
    for that just separate the hosts by a blank space [ eg: 127.0.0.1 192.168.1.68 ]


# Framework additional settings
    Additional tool settings can be configurated just by editing the 'settings' file
    before running the tool, settings like: use decoys [ scanning WAN networks ] or
    spoof mac addr [ change mac addr + ip addr ] among other default settings.
